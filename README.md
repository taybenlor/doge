# Instadoge Readme

## Getting Started

You'll need to install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) before you're able to build this app. Cocoapods is kind of like Rubygems but for iOS apps. It's available as a ruby gem so just do:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

The pods required for the app are listed in the `Podfile`. Run the following command to install them:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Then you want to open the `.xcworkspace` file in XCode. Make sure you open the workspace otherwise the pods won't be available.

Happy programming!
